A repository made for my CodeWars challenges solutions. Currently completed over 400 coding challenges (katas). Pushing one solution each day.

<h2>How It's Made:</h2>
<p>Tech used:</p>
<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/devicons/devicon/master/icons/javascript/javascript-original.svg" alt="javascript" width="40" height="40"/> </a> 

<p>I start each day with a coding challenge!</p>


<h2>Optimizations</h2>
<p>Regularly I refactor my solutions, make them shorter, more readable, and easier to understand.</p>

<h2>Lessons Learned:</h2>
<p>My biggest take away that I learned is that everyone's solutions are different, no piece of code is identical, and not knowing the answer is normal, as long as you learn from it.</p>
